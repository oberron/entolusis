# Drought in late iron age

It seems now established that 3 drought events were recorded in Mediterean bassin [doi: 10.1016/j.jas.2012.01.029](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2012.01.029)
* Younger Dryas 
* an aridization event at 3150 BC
* 1150 BC - collapse of Mediteranean bronze age civilisation (aka sea people invading Egypt)
