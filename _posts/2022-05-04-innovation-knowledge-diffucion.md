# Innovation and knowledge diffusion

Invention and innovation can be best explained as diffusion of knowledge of both risk and opportunity with a logistic equation.

The relative ration of risk vs opportunity at the different stages (invention, innovation) and associated ratio can then explain:

* Garner Hype Cycle
* Product Life Cycle S Curve
* Innovator Chasm
* Unicorn vs Camel

Carr, Nigel. (2017). A Mathematical Justification of the Gartner Hype Curve A Mathematical Formulation of the Emerging Risk Curve and Justification for the Gartner Hype Cycle. In this paper, a mathematical formula is developed for the curve of emerging risk and the Gartner Hype Cycle. This is based on six specific assumptions which are well known in business and can be defined numerically. As well as an equation for the Gartner Hype Cycle curve, this also proposes a mathematical justification.

N2  - In this paper applications of logistic S-curve and component logistics are considered in a framework of long-term forecasting of emerging technologies. Several questions and issues are discussed in connection with the presented ways of studying the transition from invention to innovation and further evolution of technologies. First, the features of a simple logistic model are presented and diverse types of competition are discussed. Second, a component logistic model is presented. Third, a hypothesis about the usability of a knowledge growth description and simulation for reliable long-term forecasting is proposed. Some interim empirical results for applying networks of contradictions are given.
