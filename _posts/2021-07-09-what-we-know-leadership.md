> First, leadership solves the problem of how to organize collective effort; consequently, it is the key to organizational effectiveness

> Second, and more important from a moral perspective, bad leaders perpetrate terrible mis- ery on those subject to their domain

> This article tries to make three points. The first is that leadership matters; it is hugely con- sequential for the success of organizations and the well-being of employees and citizens. Sec- ond, when conceptualized in the context of hu- man origins, it becomes clear that leadership is an adaptive tool for individual and group sur- vival. We believe that, in essence, leadership primarily concerns building and maintaining ef- fective teams: persuading people to give up, for a while, their selfish pursuits and pursue a com- mon goal. Our final point is that the personality of a leader affects the performance of a team: Who we are determines how we lead

On the other hand, a review of sociology, anthropology, and evolutionary psychology suggests an alternative generalization that, in fact, is two related generalizations. First, people always live in groups; we evolved as group- living animals. Second, every group has a status hierarchy; there are people at the bottom, in the middle, and at the top, and everyone knows who is where. This suggests that the most important problems in life concern getting along with other people and achieving some measure of status. We refer to these concerns as “getting along” and “getting ahead,” and individual dif- ferences in these capabilities predict a wide range of occupational outcomes (see J. Hogan & Holland, 2003). It is also worth noting that effective leaders are skilled at building relation- ships and acquiring status

> Most studies define leadership in terms of emergence—the person in a group of strangers who exerts the most influence—or in terms of ratings of an individual “leader” by more senior “leaders.” Although very few stud- ies have used indices of group performance as the criterion for leadership,1 we believe this is the most appropriate way to define and evaluate leadership. With this definition in mind, we turn to a discussion of what we know about leadership.

> the literature on implicit leadership theories suggests the characteristics people look for in their leaders; this research also tells us which of the positive attributes listed by C. Peterson and Seligman (2004) define effective leaders in the eyes of the led. In order of importance, the four themes that appear regularly in this literature—the leader- ship virtues are: 
* integrity
* decisiveness,
* competence, and 
* vision 
(e.g., Kouzes & Posner, 2002; Lord, Foti, & DeVader, 1984).
