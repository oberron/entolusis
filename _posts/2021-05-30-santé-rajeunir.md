* recommendation for at least seven hours nightly. Seven hours is generally considered to be healthy 

* Twice-daily breathing exercises that elicit the Relaxation Response were prescribed for stress reduction. It was recently demonstrated that 60 days of relaxation practice designed to elicit the Relaxation Response, 20 minutes twice per day, could significantly reduce DNAmAge as measured 

* For example, regular tai chi practice was associated with slowing of age-related DNA methylation

* modest, but significant, reduction in DNAmAge in individuals consuming a non-specific lean meat, fish and plant-based diet (as measured by blood carotenoids) has been observed [12]. It is possible that changes of a greater magnitude require a more targeted approach. The dietary intervention used here was also plant-centered, but including a high intake of nutrients that are substrates or cofactors in methylation biosynthetic pathways (e.g. containing folate, betaine), ten-eleven translocation (TET) demethylase cofactors and modulators (e.g. alpha ketoglutarate, vitamin C and vitamin A) [13] and polyphenolic modulators of DNA methyl transferases (DNMT) (e.g. curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), rosmarinic acid, quercetin, luteolin) [14]. It also included limited nutrient-dense animal proteins (e.g. liver, egg). The diet restricted carbohydrates and included mild intermittent fasting, both designed to lower glycemic cycling. The diet was supplemented daily with a fruit and vegetable powder, also rich in polyphenolic modulators of DNMT activity, and a probiotic providing 40 million CFU of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v.
