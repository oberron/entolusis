# PST 2 EML with .py

> convert .pst files with .py

if for a while you've been stuck with libpst and readpst to convert .pst files (Microsoft ugly archive format), 
be rejoiced there is a new python module `libratom` converting .pst files to folder hiearchy of .eml files! 
It also handles the latest unicode .pst format which the libpst could not.

As always there is a catch:
1. if you convert your file to `utf-8` then Outlook cannot open them properly (character jibberish here and there)
2. if you convert them to the `utf-16be` then Outlook can open them correctly but you are stuck with utf-16...

## USAGE

Assuming you have a file called `myarchive.pst` in the current folder

```python
from libratom.lib.pff import PffArchive
from email import generator
from pathlib import Path


archive = PffArchive("myarchive.pst")
eml_out = Path(Path.cwd() / "emls")

if not eml_out.exists():
  eml_out.mkdir()

def clean_file_name(message_title):
   for c in [":","/"]:
      message_title = message_title.replace(c,"_")
   return message_title+".eml"

print("Writing messages to .eml")
for folder in archive.folders():
    if folder.get_number_of_sub_messages() != 0:
        for message in folder.sub_messages:
            fn = clean_file_name(message.subject)
            # Warning 
            encoding_outlook = "utf-16be" # but you're stuck with that choice for eveer
            encoding_utf8 = "utf-8" #but if you double click on it Outlook will display some gibberish
            with open("emls/"+fn,'w',encoding="encoding_utf8") as fo:
               eml_body = archive.format_message(message)
               fo.write(archive.format_message(message))
print("Done!")
```

## INSTALLATION

> Nothing unusual here :)

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\scripts\activate
python -m pip install libratom
python myscript.py
```

note on windows you'll need to install the VC++ compiler

## TESTING

If you are brave you might want to run your enhanced scripts against the [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/)
