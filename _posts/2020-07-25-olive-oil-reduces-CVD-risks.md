# Olive olive consumption reduces CardioVascular Disease

* Olive oil known to be associated in lower risk of CVD in Mediterranean populations
* Little was known for non Mediterranean populations
* Cohort study on US population showed reduced CVD risk when replacing fats with olive oil

## Background

> Olive oil intake has been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) in Mediterranean populations, but little is known about these associations in the U.S
population.

## CONDENSED ABSTRACT: 
> Findings from two large cohort studies, including 61,181 women
from the Nurses’ Health Study (1990-2014) and 31,797 men from the Health Professional’s
Follow-up Study (1990-2014), and 9,797 incident cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD),
showed that higher olive oil intake was prospectively associated with a lower risk of coronary
heart disease (CHD) and total CVD. The substitution of margarine, butter, mayonnaise, and dairy
fat with olive oil could lead to a lower risk of CHD and CVD. These findings support current
recommendations to replace saturated fat and animal fat with unsaturated plant oils, such as olive
oil, for the prevention of CVD.
