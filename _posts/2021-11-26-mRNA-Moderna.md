# mRNA and Moderna

Notes from : 
> [IEE mRNA and Moderna][1]

[Moderna Announces Positive Data from Phase 2 Study of mRNA VEGF-A Therapeutic in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery][2]

also
> When only limited amounts of protein are needed for a short time to heal damaged tissue, mRNA can get the job doneâ€”think muscle repair following a heart attack, or neural recovery after a stroke. Genome-editing companies such as Intellia Therapeutics are also turning to mRNA to deliver components of the CRISPR-Cas9 machinery for one-and-done gene therapies in people with inherited DNA defects.

in 2015 Moderna plan was
> to move 100 drug candidates into clinical testing within the next 10 years, using mRNA to treat everything from cancer to rare genetic diseases.

> Fast-forward two-thirds of a decade and [...] plan has largely fallen through. Faced with the many challenges involved with transforming mRNA technologies into therapeutics, the company opted to pivot to vaccines instead.

>To tackle a lifelong health condition, however, any mRNA drug would have to make bucketloads of protein. Yet, the short-lived nature of the molecule, along with its attendant side effects, currently precludes administering repeated doses of mRNA on any schedule capable of having a therapeutic effect.

## HEART

> The mRNA therapy encodes the genetic recipe for making a growth factor, called VEGF-A, which helps promote blood vessel growth and is designed to regenerate damaged muscles in the heart.

## Questions:

* what are the `attendant side effects, currently precludes administering repeated doses of mRNA on any schedule capable of having a therapeutic effect.` ?
  * linked [article in nature from sept 2021][3] says ` but the toxicities associated with mRNA and their associated lipid nanoparticle delivery systems typically preclude those kinds of frequent administration strategies.`
