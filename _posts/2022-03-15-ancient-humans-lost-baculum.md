# Ancient humans lost their penis bones for a conterintuitive reason

> Most primate males have a baculum, so humans are rather an oddity in that they donâ€™t have one. In a handful of extraordinary circumstances human males have formed bones in the soft tissue at the end of their penises, but this is a rare abnormality, rather than a baculum.

>We found that, over the entire course of primate evolution, having a baculum was linked to longer intromission durations (anything over three minutes). On top of this, males of primate species with longer intromission durations tend to have far longer bacula than males of species where intromission is short.

>Another interesting discovery was that males of species facing high levels of sexual competition for females have longer bacula than those facing lower levels of sexual competition.

>But bonobos only copulate for about 15 seconds at a time and they still have a baculum, even if it is very small (about 8mm)
