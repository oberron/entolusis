# Vagal tone

> Because increased vagal activity has been associated
with a reduction in the risk of death,6 we hypothesized that the heart rate after exercise may be an important predictor of mortality

## autonomous nervous system

Autonomic nervous system, which controls such involuntary body functions as breathing, blood pressure, heartbeat, and the dilation
or constriction of key blood vessels and small airways in the lungs called bronchioles.

The two divisions of the autonomic nervous system are the:

* sympathetic division : associated with fight-or-flight response
* the parasympathetic division: rest and digest

## The Vagus Nerve & The Parasympathetic Nervous System

> The sympathetic nervous system functions like a gas pedal in a car. 
It triggers the fight-or-flight response, providing the body with a burst of energy so that it can respond to perceived dangers. 
The parasympathetic nervous system acts like a brake. It promotes the "rest and digest" response that calms the body down after
the danger has passed.
