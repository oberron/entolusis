Letâ€™s take a look at the six most common types of business meetings, including:

Status Update Meetings
Decision-Making Meetings
Problem-Solving Meetings
Team-Building Meetings
Idea-Sharing Meetings
Innovation Meetings


Remember: every meeting has both a human connection outcome and a work outcome.


Weekly team meetings often fail because people run them like project status updates instead of team meetings, focusing too heavily on content at the expense of connection, and their teams are weaker for it.
