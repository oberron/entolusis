I have some bad news and some good news. The bad news is that there are a large number of unsolvable problems in your life, both at work and at home. I’m not talking about difficulties you could solve if you had more money, time, or other resources. I’m talking about difficulties that are inherently unsolvable—ones you cannot solve with resources. The good news is that you can stop trying to solve them. Instead, you can improve your skills in identifying unsolvable problems and managing them well. That is what this book is all about.

As a leader, you can improve your effectiveness considerably if you are able to lead effective crusades and lead effective tradition-bearing efforts. I know that right now all the hype centers on being a great leader of change, and that orientation seems to support the crusading forces. But what I am suggesting is that effective change management requires the ability to be both a crusader and a tradition bearer. It also means dealing well with your opposition and with the “undecided” who are not sure which way to go. Paradoxically, to be really effective at crusading, you will need to be really effective at tradition bearing, and vice versa.

The goal of any crusade, from a Polarity Management perspective, is to maximize the upsides of each pole while minimizing the downsides.

The ongoing goal in Polarity Management is to stay in the upper two quadrants as much as possible. When individuals, organizations, or countries treat a manageable polarity as if it were a problem to solve, they will spend unnecessary time experiencing the downsides of that polarity. In other words, they will not manage it very well.

> Three Polarity Pitfalls 
> 1)  Polarity Management as the “Answer” to Everything “If all you have in your toolkit is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” 
> 2)  Avoiding the Issue “We cannot solve it, so let’s forget it.” 
> 3)  No Decisions “If it is not a problem to solve, there are no decisions to be made.”

> The One Pole Myth is: “If you stay on one pole, you will get the upside and downside of that pole while avoiding the downside of the opposite pole.” 
> On the contrary, the one pole reality is: over-emphasize one pole and you get its downside (move A–B in Figure 32). Over-emphasize one pole for a long time and you get the downsides of both poles (B + C in Figure 32). You also tend to lose the benefits of both the over-emphasized pole and the neglected pole (see Figure 32).
