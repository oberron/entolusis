Hardened wood as a renewable alternative to steel and plastic

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2021.09.020

* Natural wood materials are processed into a HW with a 23-fold increase in hardness
* The HW can be processed into different shapes for various applications
 *An HW table knife can be nearly 3 times sharper than most commercial table knives
* An HW nail can be as functional as a steel nail with comparable performance
