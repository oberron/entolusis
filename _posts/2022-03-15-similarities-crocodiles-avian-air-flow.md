>  Although conventional wisdom is that unidirectional flow is important for the high activity and basal metabolic rates for which birds are renowned, the widespread occurrence of this pattern of flow in crocodilians indicates otherwise. Furthermore, these results show that air sacs are not requisite for unidirectional flow, and therefore raise questions about the function of avian air sacs.
