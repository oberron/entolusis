>Zhengnengliang, or positive energy, was originally a term used in physics. It became popular with the book Positive Energy by Richard Wiseman, a British psychologist.

>Wiseman described the human body as an energy field and that by stimulating one's inner potential, people could become more confident and vibrant.

>Now positive energy has developed into a catchphrase in Chinese society where people approach life with optimism and confidence.

>Things associated with positive thinking such as optimism, frugality, hardwork and things that are inspiring are called "positive energy".

>Now Chinese people are hailing social development and spreading positive energy, which highlights the public's hope and desire for the betterment of people's livelihoods on the road toward a moderately well-off society.
